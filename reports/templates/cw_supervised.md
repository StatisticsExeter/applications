title: "Predicting Passenger Injury in Single Car Road Collisions"
author: "Anonymous"
---

## Overview (replace this section)

Briefly describe the aim of this report.
You should state:

- what is being predicted (passenger injury)
- what type of data is being used (road collision data)
- what kind of models you are fitting (classification models)

Example:

"This report investigates whether it is possible to predict whether a passenger was injured in a road traffic collision using a small number of variables describing the time of the collision, the vehicle, and the driver."

Do not describe code or implementation details here.

## The data (edit and expand)

Describe the dataset used in your analysis.

You should mention:

- the source of the data (STATS19 road collision data)
- that the data were restricted to single‑vehicle collisions
- that collisions involving pedestrians were excluded
- that each row corresponds to a single collision

List the variables used in the analysis:

- `day_of_year`
- `hour_of_day`
- `speed_limit`
- `engine_capacity_cc`
- `vehicle_age`
- `driver_age`
- `passenger_injured` (outcome variable)

Briefly explain any data cleaning:

- removal of missing values
- removal of "unknown" sentinel values (e.g. -1)

You may include a small summary table of group means if helpful.  You may find some other exploratory data analysis informative as well (see later).

## Class balance (important)

Describe the distribution of the outcome variable.

You should explicitly state:

- which class is the majority
- which class is the minority
- whether the dataset is balanced or imbalanced

Explain why this matters:

- why accuracy can be misleading
- why a trivial classifier might appear to perform well
- why threshold‑free metrics are useful

You may not need to "fix" imbalance unless you choose to, but you must acknowledge it.

## Exploratory analysis (describe, do not dump plots)

Briefly describe any exploratory analysis carried out.

If you include scatterplots:

- explain what is being plotted
- comment on whether the two classes appear separable

You are not expected to show separation here; absence of structure is still a result.

## Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

State that you fitted a Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier.
You should comment on:

- which variables appear to contribute most strongly
- whether the direction of effects is plausible
- whether separation appears weak or strong

Avoid copying large blocks of model output.
Focus on interpretation, not mechanics.

## Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

State that you also fitted a Quadratic Discriminant Analysis classifier.
Briefly compare QDA to LDA:

- does it behave differently?
- does it appear to fit the data better or worse?
- are there signs of instability or overfitting?

You do not need to prefer QDA over LDA but you do need to justify whatever you observe.

## Model evaluation (ROC and AUC)

Describe how the classifiers were evaluated.

You should:

- explain what an ROC curve represents (in brief)
- report AUC values for your models
- compare performance between models

Comment on:

- whether performance is meaningfully better than random
- how class imbalance affects interpretation
- whether one model clearly dominates

Avoid overstating results; modest performance is expected.

## Limitations and extensions (short but thoughtful)

Briefly discuss limitations of this analysis.
Possible points include:

- limited number of features
- strong class imbalance
- simplifying assumptions of the models
- lack of causal interpretation

You may outline possible extensions:

- alternative classifiers
- feature engineering
- rebalancing methods
- different evaluation metrics


## Conclusion (very short)

Summarise, in 3–4 sentences:

- what you attempted
- what worked reasonably
- what did not
- what you would explore next

Do not introduce new results here.
